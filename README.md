# Titanic Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics, ticket details, and whether they survived the disaster.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following key columns:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger (dropped in the analysis as it doesn't contribute to the analysis).
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- **Name**: Name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number (dropped in the analysis as it doesn't contribute to the analysis).
- **Fare**: Fare paid for the ticket.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number (dropped due to high number of missing values).
- **Embarked**: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading

- The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
- The first few rows of the dataset were previewed to understand its structure.

### 2. Data Cleaning

- **Missing Values**: Identified columns with missing data and filled them:
  - Filled missing values in the `Embarked` column with the mode.
  - Filled missing values in the `Age` column with the median.
  - Dropped the `Cabin` column due to a high number of missing values.
- **Irrelevant Columns**: Dropped `PassengerId`, `Ticket`, and `Cabin` columns as they do not provide significant value for the analysis.
- **Duplicates**: Checked for and removed any duplicate rows.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Univariate Analysis**:
  - Plotted the distribution of the `Age` column using a histogram.
  - Displayed the survival count using a bar plot.

- **Bivariate Analysis**:
  - Visualized the survival rate by gender using a bar plot.
  - Explored the relationship between `Age` and `Fare` with respect to survival using a scatter plot.

### 4. Key Insights

- **Age Distribution**: Most passengers were young adults.
- **Survival Count**: Only about 38% of passengers survived.
- **Survival by Gender**: A higher percentage of females survived compared to males.
- **Age vs. Fare**: There was a diverse range of fares, with no clear correlation between age and fare with respect to survival.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   !pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

2. Run the provided Python code in a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab to replicate the analysis.

## Files

- **train.csv**: Original dataset used for analysis.
- **test.csv**: Additional dataset, if needed for further analysis or modeling.
- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the demographics and survival rates of Titanic passengers. The analysis highlights key factors that influenced survival, such as gender and age, providing a foundation for further predictive modeling or deeper analysis.
